  "In the United States Coast Guard, the coxswain is the person in charge of a small boat and its crew. The coxswain has the authority to direct all boat and crew activities during the mission and can modify planned missions to provide for the safety of the boat and the crew. At station Chatham, I earned the privilege of being a certified coxswain on the multiple boat types which were valued up to a million dollars. <strong>I accumulated more than 200 underway hours as a coxswain and completed a multitude of missions including, training unit personnel underway, assisting distressed boaters, and medical emergencies. </strong>",
"Coast Guard Boarding Officers are responsible for leading, directing and training Maritime Law Enforcement Teams. To become a Boarding Officer, you must complete 6 weeks of law enforcement training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Charleston, South Carolina. During this training you are exposed to the authority and jurisdictions of Coast Guard law enforcement, local and international maritime laws and statutes, as well as critical stress management and decision making in deadly force situations. <strong>As a Boarding Officer I lead law enforcement teams in over 50 recreational boating safety boardings and more than 35 Maritime Security and Response Operations.</strong>",
"The Officer of the Day (OOD) is responsible for supervising, planning, and executing the daily activities at the unit. The OOD must have critical thinking and extensive knowledge of each mission the unit preforms. During the duty period, which ranges from 48 to 72 hours, the OOD must maintain the unit’s readiness to respond to a multitude of missions during <strong>all</strong> hours of that duty period. The OOD must also have fluid and effective planning to balance training personnel and maintaining unit readiness for missions. This includes maintaining proper boat crews and law enforcement teams that are ready to undertake and complete any mission that may come up. <strong>As the Officer of the Day, I planned and executed upwards of 50 law enforcement events, 7 search and rescue cases, and the training and certification of 10 junior personnel in a collection of qualifications. </strong>"]

  "In addition to daily helpdesk support, I participated, planned and executed various projects including: <br><br><strong>Adaptation of the Help Desk</strong>: Before joining the team, there was no help desk or ticketing system since the Director of Technology was the only support for the company. Once I was hired, I was assigned with the company adaptation of a help desk ticketing system. During this time, I created the operating standards for the ticketing system and educated the company on those new standards and use of the ticketing system (ZenDesk). I set up auto forwarding to the Zendesk ticketing system as well as automated replies for solved tickets. This benefited the IT department with an organization tool increasing our response time and rate on tickets. <br><br> <strong>Development + Deployment of new Ad Displays: </strong> With the current ad displays being run by Apple TVs, it was not effective to have the display rendered unusable when a remote was lost. I was tasked to develop and deploy a new process for ad displays. I developed a way for us to display, change and update ads using a Raspberry Pi Zero W. I set each up for SSH access so we could access them from anywhere. This deployment lowered the company’s operating cost from $150 per ad display to $10.<br><br><strong>Deployment of NCR Counterpoint v8.5:</strong> During off hours, over the course of multiple months, we staged upgraded point of sales clients at all locations and stores. On deployment day, I was personally responsible to ensure all personnel were educated on and using the new NCR Client."]
