                <div id="about-me-text">
                    <p class="about-me-text-1">My name is Joseph Calise and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. For the most part I am self-taught developer driven by
                    curiosity and amazement of what can be accomplish by someone with an idea, a computer and the skill to code. In my
                    personal life I enjoy being outdoors, watching T.V and spending time with my wife and friends. I served
                    in the United States Coast Guard from 2016 to 2020 and ended my enlistment as a Boatswain’s Mate Second Class.</p>

                    <p class="about-me-text-2">Generally, Boatswain’s Mates will go on to be boat captains, cops or merchant mariners. But at the end of my enlistment,
                    I knew none of those were for me. I knew I wanted to be in technology, but I didn’t know in what capacity. My start in
                    technology was in IT with GreenCoast Hydroponics, while working there I was able to obtain my CompTIA Network+ and
                    CompTIA Security+ within less than a year of each other. From there I worked with our development team and knew that was
                    the path for me. Since my departure from GreenCoast I have made strides to accomplishing my goals and becoming a
                    Software Engineer. In this time, I have taught myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as on track to graduate in 2023
                    with a BS in Computer Science from Chapman University in Orange, CA. I look forward to continuing to pursue my passion
                    in this field and hope to grow into a seasoned Software Developer.

                    <p class="about-me-text-3">Since beginning my journey into coding and software engineering, it is incomprehensible to put into words what you can
                    do with code. Since brushing the surface, there is nothing professionally I want to be doing than this. It is no secret
                    that software engineering continues to be the future, but it is mind boggling to know that with the right knowledge and
                    creativity, you can quite literally change the world all beginning with <strong>code</strong>.</p>
